The previous AI engineer successfully launched MEWAYZ V2 from 0 to 1, establishing a FARM stack with a focus on a visually stunning Odoo-style frontend. Initial efforts included backend authentication, e-commerce, and bio-link functionalities, incorporating  and  for payments. Subsequent work addressed critical issues such as Stripe payment integration bugs (parameter errors, frontend input, false errors), deployment failures (dependency downgrades,  fixes), and UI/UX unification (consistent dark, professional theme). The engineer then implemented a detailed, aggressive launch pricing strategy (7 bundles, multi-bundle discounts, Enterprise plan), updating both backend pricing logic and frontend UI for bundle selection. This involved iterative refinement of the UI based on user feedback, ultimately achieving an ultra-professional dark theme with glass morphism effects. The latest phase involves creating additional missing static pages and integrating components from a provided GitHub repository to achieve final polishing and responsiveness across the application.

The core objective of MEWAYZ V2 is to be a frontend-heavy Odoo clone tailored for the creator economy, aiming for aggressive user acquisition (10,000+ registered users, 80% month-2 retention by Dec 30, 2024) through a stunning UI/UX. The application must support detailed pricing bundles:  (/bin/bash),  (9/month),  (4/month),  (9/month),  (9/month),  (9/month), and  (4/month), with annual discounts. A multi-bundle discount system (20-40%) and an  (15% revenue share, min 9/month) are essential. The platform will also implement revenue-share models for transactions (2.4% escrow fee), template sales (15% commission), and vendor customer referrals (3% fee on rewards). The UI/UX should mimic Odoo's design principles, leveraging React, TailwindCSS, and animation libraries, maintaining a professional, consistently dark theme. The current implementation includes a functional FastAPI backend with e-commerce, payment, and bio-link modules, a professional dark-themed landing page, and an interactive multi-step onboarding wizard with re-enabled Stripe payment integration for card saving and processing. The pricing structure and bundles have been integrated into the frontend onboarding and a dedicated pricing page. All pages need to be ultra-professional and responsive.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has most recently focused on completing and refining the application's UI/UX to be ultra-professional while adhering to a consistent dark theme, especially for the pricing and onboarding flows.

Key accomplishments immediately prior to this summary:
1.  **Comprehensive Pricing Implementation**: The backend () was updated with the new 7-bundle pricing structure (Free Starter, Creator, E-commerce, Social Media, Education, Business, Operations) including monthly and yearly rates.
2.  **Onboarding Bundle Selection Redesign**: The  and  files were extensively modified. This involved multiple iterations of UI refinement based on user feedback.

The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a frontend-only Odoo clone, named MEWAYZ V2, focusing on an aggressive user acquisition pricing strategy. Initially, the approach wavered between starting from scratch, using an open-source Odoo project, or integrating a Laravel project. After some exploration of Odoo's structure and available React-Odoo integrations, the user emphasized deployment through Emergent, guiding the AI engineer to select the React-Admin framework. The engineer proceeded to set up the basic React environment, install necessary dependencies like Heroicons and React-Admin, and modify core frontend files (, , ) to align with Odoo's styling and a monolithic component structure. The current state reflects the groundwork laid for building the React-Admin based Odoo-style interface, but the actual implementation of the UI components and integration of pricing bundles is still pending.

The user requires a frontend-only clone of Odoo, dubbed MEWAYZ V2, emphasizing a visually stunning replica with an AHA MOMENT through design, colors, layout, and polished interactions. The core functionality centers around an aggressive user acquisition pricing strategy detailed for December 30, 2024. This strategy includes:
- **Pricing Bundles:** FREE STARTER, CREATOR (9/month), E-COMMERCE (4/month), SOCIAL MEDIA (9/month), EDUCATION (9/month), BUSINESS (9/month), and OPERATIONS (4/month), each with specific features and launch specials.
- **Multi-Bundle Discounts:** 20% off for 2 bundles, 30% off for 3, and 40% off for 4+ bundles.
- **Enterprise Plan:** 15% revenue share (min 9/month), including all bundles, white-label, dedicated support, and API access.
- **Launch Revenue-Share Model:** Escrow (2.4% fee), Template Marketplace (15% commission), Vendor Customer Referrals (3% fee).
The goal is to acquire 10,000+ registered users in 6 months with an 80% month-2 retention, aiming for profitability around 800 paid users. The implementation focuses on replicating Odoo's UI/UX, typography, color strategy, and page components using React, TailwindCSS, and animation libraries.

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance:** The main React component, serving as the root of the application's UI. It was initially a basic scaffold.
    -   **Changes:** The file was completely rewritten to integrate the new Odoo-style UI structure, likely setting up the main layout and incorporating elements from .

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance:** A new file created to centralize all React components, following a monolithic component design approach specified in the guidelines. This is where individual UI elements (like pricing cards, navigation, etc.) are expected to be defined.
    -   **Changes:** This file was newly created, acting as a container for all future UI components for the Odoo clone.

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance:** Contains global CSS styles that apply across the entire application, essential for establishing overall typography, color palette, and base styling.
    -   **Changes:** This file was updated to implement Odoo's modern styling, including its color scheme, typography system (font weights, line heights, letter-spacing), and potentially atmospheric gradients, as per the design requirements.

-    & :
    -   **Summary of importance:** Configuration files for Tailwind CSS and PostCSS, respectively, crucial for defining the project's design system, custom themes, and processing CSS efficiently.
    -   **Changes:** No explicit changes were shown in the trajectory, but they are essential for TailwindCSS and PostCSS to function as intended with the updated CSS.

The current architecture is a React single-page application aiming to replicate Odoo's UI, leveraging React-Admin for rapid development of an enterprise-like interface, with all components consolidated into  and global styles managed by  and TailwindCSS.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the comprehensive Odoo-style admin interface using React-Admin.
- Incorporate all specified MEWAYZ V2 pricing bundles, features, and revenue models into the UI.
- Mock all necessary data for the frontend to look complete.
- Ensure pixel-perfect design, typography, color strategy, and hover effects matching Odoo's visuals.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of building the frontend-only MEWAYZ V2 application, aiming to clone the visual design and user experience of Odoo. The initial attempts to directly use open-source Odoo code or integrate a Laravel project were refined. The decision was made to proceed with a **React frontend** and specifically utilize the **React-Admin framework** for efficient development of the Odoo-style admin interface, given the constraint of deploying directly through Emergent within a React + FastAPI + MongoDB stack (though only frontend is being developed).

So far, the following actions have been taken:
1.  **Project Setup:** The basic React project structure, including , , , , , , and , is in place.
2.  **Core File Creation/Modification:**
    *    was created to hold all components in a monolithic file as per instructions.
    *    was rewritten to serve as the main application component, likely to integrate the new UI structure.
    *    was updated to incorporate Odoo's modern styling, including color scheme and typography.
3.  **Dependency Installation:**
    *    was installed (yarn add v1.22.22

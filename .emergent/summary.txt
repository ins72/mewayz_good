The previous AI engineer began by aiming to build a frontend-only Odoo clone, MEWAYZ V2, initially considering React-Admin. The user's explicit preference for deployment through Emergent and a focus on a stunning replica with an AHA MOMENT led to a pivot from a strict Odoo-clone with React-Admin to a more flexible React + FastAPI + MongoDB (FARM) stack approach. The engineer adopted a strategy of integrating and merging existing open-source FARM stack projects. Key efforts included setting up a core backend foundation using , integrating e-commerce functionalities from , and bio-link features from . Simultaneously, the frontend was completely revamped using a user-provided  and , replacing the initial React-Admin UI and focusing on a professional, polished landing page. The primary focus has been on getting the core backend APIs and the frontend landing page operational.

The user seeks to develop MEWAYZ V2, a frontend-only Odoo clone designed for the creator economy, emphasizing a visually stunning UI/UX with an AHA MOMENT through design, colors, layout, and polished interactions. The core objective is aggressive user acquisition via a detailed pricing strategy for December 30, 2024. This includes:
-   **Pricing Bundles**: FREE STARTER, CREATOR (9/month), E-COMMERCE (4/month), SOCIAL MEDIA (9/month), EDUCATION (9/month), BUSINESS (9/month), and OPERATIONS (4/month), each with specific features.
-   **Multi-Bundle Discounts**: Tiered discounts (20%, 30%, 40%) for multiple bundles.
-   **Enterprise Plan**: 15% revenue share (min 9/month) with premium features.
-   **Launch Revenue-Share Model**: Escrow (2.4% fee), Template Marketplace (15% commission), Vendor Customer Referrals (3% fee).
The overarching goal is to acquire 10,000+ registered users in 6 months with 80% month-2 retention, targeting profitability at 800 paid users. The implementation emphasizes replicating Odoo's UI/UX, typography, color strategy, and page components using React, TailwindCSS, and animation libraries. Current implementation includes a functional backend and a professional landing page.
